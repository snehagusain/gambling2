# Wallet Feature Implementation

## Overview
We've integrated a fully functional wallet system into the BetMaster betting platform, allowing users to manage their funds, place bets, and track their transaction history.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Wallet Context
- Created a React context to manage the wallet state across the application
- Implemented functions for deposits, withdrawals, and balance retrieval
- Added transaction history management
- Integrated with Firebase Firestore for persistent data storage

### 2. User Interface
- **Balance Component**: Displays the user's current balance in the header
- **Wallet Modal**: Allows users to deposit and withdraw funds
- **Transaction History**: Shows a detailed list of all user transactions
- **Transaction Details**: Provides in-depth information for each transaction
- **WalletInfo in BetSlip**: Shows balance information in the bet slip for informed betting decisions

### 3. Transaction Types
- **Deposits**: Add funds to the user's wallet
- **Withdrawals**: Remove funds from the user's wallet
- **Bets**: Record betting activity with details of selections and stakes

### 4. Integration with Betting System
- Automatically withdraws funds when a bet is placed
- Records detailed bet information in the transaction history
- Validates sufficient balance before allowing bets

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure
- Wallet data stored in Firestore:
  - `wallets` collection: Stores user balances
  - `transactions` collection: Records all financial activities

### Components
- `WalletContext.tsx`: Central wallet state management
- `Balance.tsx`: Displays current balance in header
- `WalletModal.tsx`: UI for deposits and withdrawals
- `WalletInfo.tsx`: Shows wallet information in bet slip
- `TransactionHistory.tsx`: Lists all transactions with filtering
- `TransactionDetails.tsx`: Shows detailed transaction information

### Authentication Integration
- Wallet functionality only available to authenticated users
- Each user has their own isolated wallet and transaction history
- Secure access to funds through Firebase authentication

## Usage for End Users

1. **View Balance**: Current balance is displayed in the header when logged in
2. **Deposit Funds**: Click on the balance to open the wallet modal and select "Deposit"
3. **Withdraw Funds**: Open the wallet modal and select "Withdraw"
4. **View Transactions**: Access transaction history from the wallet modal
5. **Place Bets**: The system automatically validates and deducts the stake from the wallet

## Technical Notes

- All financial transactions are recorded with timestamps and status
- Bet transactions include detailed information about selections and odds
- The system ensures users cannot bet more than their available balance
- Transaction history can be filtered by type (deposits, withdrawals, bets)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the wallet system:
- Support for multiple payment methods
- Currency conversion for international users
- Enhanced transaction analytics
- Promotional credits and bonuses
